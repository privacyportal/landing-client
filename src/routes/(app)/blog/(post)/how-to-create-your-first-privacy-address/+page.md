### Create a Privacy Address from the Web App

You can easily create a new Privacy Address like the following:

1. Go to the **[Mail Relay Page](https://app.privacyportal.org/mail-relay)**
2. Press on **"New Address"**
3. Enter a label to easily identify this new address
4. Press on **"Create Address"**

Now that your new Privacy Address is created, you can start receiving emails on this address. Any email sent to this address will get relayed to your personal email address.

### Create a Privacy Address from the browser

If you install the Privacy Portal web app on your device, depending on the operating system you will have additional ways to create new addresses. For example, on Android, you can quickly create a new Privacy Address while browsing the web:

1. From any page in your browser where you need to create a new Privacy Address, share the webpage by tapping on your browser's "Share..." button.
2. Select the "Privacy Portal" app as your sharing destination. This should open the Privacy Portal app and prefill the "label" for you.
3. Edit the label and note to your liking, then "Create" the new Privacy Address. The new address should automatically be added to your clipboard and ready to use.

### Create a Privacy Address from your email client

You can also create Privacy Addresses directly from your email client.

1. Create a new email draft to "new@pportal.io" from your registered personal email address.
2. Anything you write in the subject field will be used to label your new Privacy Address.
3. Once sent, you will receive a confirmation email from Mail Relay with information about your newly created "Privacy Address".
