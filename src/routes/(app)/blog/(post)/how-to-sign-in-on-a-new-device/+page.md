Privacy Portal uses passwordless authentication for better privacy and security. When you sign up, your credentials get stored securely on your device. Depending on your operating system, your credentials could get automatically synced across all your devices allowing you to sign in from any of your devices without additional steps.

Additionally, if you're signing in from a new device for one time only, you can use passkey from one of your registered devices to authorize the login without storing any credentials on the temporary device.

In case your credentials aren't automatically synced across all your devices, you can manually register additional devices or security keys to allow you to sign in from additional devices.

##### Registering a new device

1. Go to the **[Security page](https://app.privacyportal.org/settings/security)**
2. Press on **"New Authenticator"**
3. Press on **"Other Device"**
4. Continue on the new device
5. Open the URL using the QR code or by copying and pasting the URL
6. Enter a label for your new device (e.g. "mobile")

8. Your device is now registered but still requires activation
9. Back on the **[Security page](https://app.privacyportal.org/settings/security)** of your old device, activate your new authenticator by pressing on **"activate"**
