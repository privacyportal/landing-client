At any point in time, you can deactivate a Privacy Address and stop receiving emails through that address.

1. Go to the **[Mail Relay Page](https://app.privacyportal.org/mail-relay)**
2. Select the address in question (or use search to find it)
3. Switch off the **"Forward to"** toggle. Once switched off, Mail Relay will drop any emails sent to this address. The sender will not receive any delivery errors.
4. If you would like the sender to receive delivery errors, Switch on the **"Reject Incoming Mail"** toggle. This can be helpful to unsubscribe you from some mailing lists.

You can also delete inactive addresses at any point in time.
