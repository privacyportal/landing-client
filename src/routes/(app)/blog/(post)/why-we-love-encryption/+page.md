Today marks the first occurrence of **Global Encryption Day**. Despite its young age, this holiday is very dear to us at Privacy Portal. It helps spread the word on the importance of encryption and the reasons we all need to protect it against those who wish to undermine it. Encryption is the foundation enabling privacy in the digital age.

##### What is encryption?

In simple terms, encryption is a process that allows converting a clear message to a secret one. The reverse process is called decryption, it allows converting back the secret message to the original one.

##### How is it useful?

Encryption is an essential building block of the internet today. It allows computers around the globe to communicate privately and securely. Every time you visit a website using _HTTPS_ for example, the communication between your machine and the website is encrypted. This is required by all personalized online services such as banking, e-commerce, online chat, video calls, social media, ...

Encryption is also used to store data securely. For example, high end smartphones use encryption to store data on disk. This prevents someone with physical access to your device from being able to read your data without your consent. This type of encryption, called Encryption-At-Rest, is heavily used in cloud services and databases to store user data securely.

##### What is end-to-end encryption?

End-to-End encryption is a process that allows users to communicate privately without allowing any third party (not even the communication platform itself) from accessing the messages. This has privacy advantages over systems where the platform has access to all messages.
