## Introduction

Welcome to Privacy Portal (“Company”, “we”, “our”, “us”)!

Our Terms Of Service (“Terms”) establish the rules for using the privacyportal.org website and making use of a Privacy Portal Account (“Account”) and all its related features, including Mail Relay and Sign In With Privacy Portal (“Services”).

By using Services, creating an Account, or keeping an Account open (not deleted) you express your consent to adhere to and be bound by the terms specified in these Terms. Your continued use implies your understanding and acceptance of these Terms.

## Privacy

Our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> governs your use of the Services and explains how we minimize the use of your personal information.

## Authorized Users

The Services are intended for access and use only by individuals who are at least thirteen (13) years old. Minors are required to have parental or legal guardian consent to use the Services.

Each individual user bears exclusive responsibility for all actions carried out using the provided Services.

## Description of the Services

Company provides software services designed to help our users protect their personal information online. To achieve this, our Services use multiple techniques such as:

- Requiring the least amount of personal information possible to operate the Services.
- Using encryption in-transit and at-rest.
- Offering Virtual Email Addresses (or Privacy Addresses) designed to privately relay emails to and from the user's personally identifiable email. These Privacy Addresses use shared email domains across all our users for better privacy.
- Preventing user metadata leaks in email headers by masking personally identifiable information such as the user's IP address.
- Providing granular controls to fight spam.
- Never logging nor storing the contents of emails relayed through our services.
- Never sharing our users personal information with any third party.
- Using secure and phishing-proof authentication mechanisms.
- Operating a privacy focused OpenID Connect provider.

To protect ourselves, our Services, and our users, we proactively reject emails originating from untrusted senders or senders with a bad reputation. We also reject any suspicious emails or emails we believe to be harmful or unsolicited. Using our Services to initiate such emails is strictly prohibited and would be a breach of our Acceptable Use Policy.

## Account

Our Services are currently offered as beta software. While the Services are in beta, all subscription plans are provided free of charge with minor functionality restrictions to prevent abuse.

At the end of the beta period, you will have the option to use our pre-paid plan for a monthly cost otherwise your Account will automatically get downgraded to the free plan.

We reserve the right to refuse service, terminate accounts, remove or edit content, or cancel orders in our sole discretion.
